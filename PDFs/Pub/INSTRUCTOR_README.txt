Instructors: Please use the PPT slides to teach from while in Slideshow/Presentation mode.

You can use the Instructor Guide to practice and learn from. Some instructors like to have the Instructor Guide on a separate monitor, iPad-like device or printed out so they can see the instructor notes while teaching. See Appendix Z in the Instructor Guide for lab setup instructions.

The speaker notes below each slide can be used by you to paraphrase and/or elaborate on what is on the slides.

Students should only get the Participant Guide and *not* the slides. Slides have instructor notes and are too big to give to students anyway. Students may already have a PDF copy of the Participant Guide via a link in their training confirmation email but we have provided it here in case they don't.

The Participant Guide PDF allows for copy/paste so students can catch up by pasting code if they fall behind the class. The Participant Guide has instructor notes hidden.

Notice that the guides have the course version numbers on them and they should all match so please don't mix and match versions since pagination could become an issue if you do.

Thank you and good luck.
